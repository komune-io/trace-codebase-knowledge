# Tutorial: trace-registry

The `trace-registry` project is a sophisticated digital system for managing and tracking information about **projects**, particularly *environmental initiatives*, and their associated **assets** like *carbon credits or certificates*. It achieves this by organizing data into **Catalogues** (akin to library sections) and **Datasets** (specific information items), using standardized metadata formats like *DCAT/DCAT-AP* for discoverability.

The system's architecture relies on **S2 Event Sourcing** to record every change as an *immutable event*, providing a full audit trail and enabling the reconstruction of current states for entities like Catalogues and Projects. Backend functionalities are primarily exposed through **F2 Function-Based APIs**, which handle specific *commands* (to perform actions) and *queries* (to request information) in an event-driven manner.

For managing compliance and verification, the project incorporates the **CCCEV (Core Criterion and Core Evidence Vocabulary)** standard, allowing the definition of *Requirements* and the linking of *Evidences* to demonstrate fulfillment. The entire application, composed of various microservices, is built, tested, and deployed using **automated infrastructure** leveraging Docker, GitHub Actions, and Makefiles.
