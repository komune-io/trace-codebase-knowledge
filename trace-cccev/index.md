# Tutorial: trace-cccev

The `trace-cccev` project facilitates managing **certification processes**.
It allows defining complex *Requirements* based on the standard CCCEV vocabulary, including associated *InformationConcepts* (specific data points) and needed *Evidence* (proofs).
The system uses a **Neo4j graph database** to store these interconnected elements and provides an **F2 API** to create certifications and track their fulfillment by adding evidence and values.
